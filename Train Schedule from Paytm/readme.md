**Project: Train Schedule Web Scraping**

Welcome to the Train Schedule Web Scraping project! This project focuses on scraping train schedule information from a website and listing the trains from one station to another, along with their train numbers and departure times.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we will be using web scraping techniques to extract train schedule data from a specific website. We will specify the source and destination stations, and the program will scrape the website to retrieve the train numbers and departure times for the specified route.

**Languages and Libraries:**

Python 
BeautifulSoup library
Requests library
Selenium Web Driver
Jupyter Notebook

**Web Scraping Process**

The web scraping process covers the following steps:

Importing the required libraries.

Sending a GET request to the website and retrieving the HTML content.

Parsing the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.

Locating the relevant elements in the HTML structure.

Extracting the train numbers and departure times.

Displaying the extracted information.

**Results and Output**

The web scraping process will output a list of trains from the specified source station to the destination station, along with their train numbers and departure times. The output will be displayed in the notebook or printed in the console.
